      "When a customer books a stay at a Marriott hotel, the system would receive this information and update the customer's account in real time, rather than writing to transaction tables for later batch processing. This is facilitated by the RWDUSTY2 program, which receives and sends information to other programs through copybooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system also handles various types of promotions, bonus codes, and credit card information. It checks whether certain conditions are met to determine if a customer is eligible for a promotion or bonus. For instance, if a customer is a Platinum member, they might be eligible for a Platinum arrival bonus.\n",

      "Core Features and Functionalities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Real-time Update: The COBOL code facilitates real-time updates to the Marriott Rewards system, allowing the CRIS application to add stays instantly instead of writing to transaction tables for later batch processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Data Structures and Variables: The code defines a series of data structures and variables for various purposes such as storing and manipulating data related to customer promotions, bonus codes, credit card information, date conversions, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. SQL Queries: The code includes SQL queries for a database management system, fetching data related to benefits, partners, promotions, properties, and more. It also includes SQL INCLUDE statements to include external SQL files into the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Data Streams: The code defines data structures for writing to different data streams, each with its own set of fields. These data streams include various fields related to a hotel stay, such as the date of stay, payment type, total revenue, number of paid nights, airline partner ID, car partner ID, bonus codes, frequent flyer ID, run date and time, operator ID, confirmation number, folio name and number, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Error Handling: The code includes routines to handle SQL errors and other exceptions. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Conditional Checks: The code includes several conditional checks and operations based on these checks. These include checks for bonus market codes, platinum arrival codes, gold arrival codes, property bonus codes, breakfast bonus, and YourChoice bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Data Insertion: The code inserts data into various tables in the database, such as the HXTMRSTAYPROM table, HXTQUICKISSUE table, HXTOPERCHANGES table, HXTCUSTSTAYFOLIO table, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Bonus Calculation: The code calculates base points based on total revenue and point calculation values, and it sets certain values to zero. It also calculates stay revenue and formats actions to issue points for a stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Elite Nights Calculation: The code fetches the latest data from a database table MRSTAY and opens a cursor to get promotions. It then fetches data from the promotion cursor and checks if the SQL operation was successful. If not, it goes to a specific part of the code to handle the error. Depending on these conditions, it calculates the number of elite nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Customer Benefits Management: The code checks if the customer's bonus currency is \"MI\" (miles). If it is, it formats an action to issue bonus miles to the customer. If the bonus currency is not \"MI\", it formats an action to issue points to the customer. The number of points is calculated based on the type of bonus (Breakfast Bonus or YourChoice Bonus) and the total number of such bonuses.\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 1: Marriott Rewards System Maintenance\n",
      "Example: A Marriott Rewards member has just completed a stay at a Marriott hotel. The RWDUSTY2 program receives the stay information from the hotel's system through the RWUSTYC1 copybook. The program then updates the member's stay information in real time, instead of writing it to a transaction table for later batch processing. If there are any errors during this process, they are returned through the STYCRTRN copybook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 2: Customer Account Management\n",
      "Example: A customer logs into their account on a hotel's website. The COBOL code retrieves the customer's information, including their current promotions, credit card information, and stay dates, from various data structures. The code then checks certain conditions, such as whether the customer is eligible for certain promotions, and updates the customer's account information accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 3: Database Management\n",
      "Example: A hotel's database management system needs to retrieve specific sets of data, such as promotion data or promotion property data. The COBOL code defines SQL cursors, PROMOTION_CSR and PROMPROP_CURSOR, which are used to retrieve this data from the database. The data is then stored in a write buffer before being written to a file or sent over a network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 4: Hotel Stay Transaction Processing\n",
      "Example: A customer completes a stay at a hotel. The COBOL code defines the structure of the data record for the stay, including the date of stay, payment type, total revenue, and other details. The code then writes this data to the appropriate data stream, such as Ref-DS130 or Ref-US311.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 5: Message and Data Stream Management\n",
      "Example: A hotel's system needs to send a message named \"CHECKOUT-DATA\" when a customer checks out. The COBOL code defines the data structure for this message, including fields for account ID, stay ID, checkout name, property ID, and other details. The code then stores this data in the appropriate data stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 6: Frequent Flyer Program Management\n",
      "Example: A customer earns miles for a stay at a hotel. The COBOL code defines the data structure for the record of this stay, including the customer's frequent flyer ID, the airline partner ID, the number of paid nights, and other details. The code then writes this data to the appropriate data stream, such as ISSUE-STAYBEN or PROM-INFO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 7: Hotel Stay Data Handling\n",
      "Example: A hotel's system needs to fetch data related to a customer's stay, such as the customer's ID, the type of activity, the number of nights, and the date the activity was earned. The COBOL code defines a data structure named W-BUFF-US670 for this data, and then uses SQL queries to fetch the data from the database. The code then checks certain conditions, such as whether the customer is eligible for certain bonuses, and performs operations based on these checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 8: Hotel Stay Operations\n",
      "Example: A customer checks out from a hotel. The COBOL code moves various values, such as the partner airline, end stay date, number of nights, property ID, customer ID, and total revenue, into different fields of the W-BUFF-US293 buffer. The code then calls the \"MSBENVAL\" function using this buffer. Depending on certain conditions, such as whether the partner is \"WN\" and whether the stay type is either \"P\" or \"R\", the code performs different operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 9: Hotel Stay Error Handling\n",
      "Example: A hotel's system encounters an error while processing a customer's stay. The COBOL code inserts data related to the error into the HXTREDEEMERROR table. The code then retrieves account status information, sets up a checkout action, and checks for duplicate stays. Depending on the type of error, the code performs different operations, such as adjusting the number of nights or loading stay data into the HXTREDEEMERROR table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 10: Hotel Stay Transaction Processing\n",
      "Example: A customer completes a stay at a hotel. The COBOL code initializes several variables, inserts error data into the HXTREDEEMERROR table if necessary, checks if each certificate is a hotel certificate, increments the certificate index, sets the WS-UNUSED-CERT-FLAG to \"Y\" if a certificate is not used, retrieves and updates the frequent flyer number from the database, generates a new Stay Benefit ID, and selects the calculation type from DCLHXTPROPBASECALCPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 11: Hotel Stay Operations\n",
      "Example: A customer checks out from a hotel. The COBOL code calculates base points based on total revenue and point calculation values, sets certain values to zero, selects point calculation values from a database based on a brand ID, calculates stay revenue, formats actions to issue points for a stay, inserts a stay using a model, checks for dual currency insert features, checks for duplicate stays, and handles promotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 12: Elite Night Calculation\n",
      "Example: A hotel's reward program needs to calculate the number of elite nights for a customer. The COBOL code fetches the latest data from the MRSTAY table, opens a cursor to get promotions, fetches data from the promotion cursor, checks various conditions related to the stay dates and the promotion dates, calculates the number of elite nights, prepares for a call to an external system (EXTRANTS), and then makes the call to the external system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 13: Customer Benefit Management\n",
      "Example: A customer checks out from a hotel. The COBOL code counts back-to-back stays, checks eligibility for arrival bonuses, creates bonus stays if certain conditions are met, checks if the customer is eligible for Platinum and Gold arrival bonuses, checks if the total breakfast bonus and YourChoice bonus are greater than zero, checks if the market code is for a bonus stay, checks if the customer is eligible for a badge activity, sets up and calls an action called ACHIEVER, checks if the customer is eligible for a Club Marquis bonus, and checks if the customer is eligible for a new card.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 14: Quick Issue Handling\n",
      "Example: A hotel's system needs to quickly issue a benefit to a customer. The COBOL code fetches data from the HXTACCESSCTL table, sets default values for DEPT-ID and INITIALS in DCLHXTACCESSCTL if necessary, populates the Quick Issue DCL with various values, inserts a new row into the HXTQUICKISSUE table with the populated values, populates the OPERCHANGES with various values, inserts a new row into the HXTOPERCHANGES table with the populated values, selects ALL_BEN_ID, OPT_BONUS_VALUE, and OPT_BONUS_CURR from the HXTALLOCBEN and HXTBENEFITMASTER tables, and calls the IDGEN3 function to get a new StayBen ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 15: Customer Benefit Management\n",
      "Example: A customer checks out from a hotel. The COBOL code checks if the customer's bonus currency is \"MI\" (miles). If it is, it formats an action to issue bonus miles to the customer. If the bonus currency is not \"MI\", it formats an action to issue points to the customer. The number of points is calculated based on the type of bonus (Breakfast Bonus or YourChoice Bonus) and the total number of such bonuses. The code also checks if the customer is eligible for a dual currency association and if they are, it calculates the mileage value and issues miles to the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Case Scenario 16: Hotel Stay Operations\n",
      "Example: A hotel's system needs to display certain information and handle errors. The COBOL code moves the value of I-CUSTOMER-ID to WS-ACCT-ID-EDIT and then displays the account ID. It then moves various values to different variables and calls a procedure named \"SQLERR\" using ABEND-PARAMETERS, SQLCA, and ABEND-PARAMETERS-II.\n"

      "The COBOL code provided is part of a larger program that manages various aspects of a hotel stay system, including customer benefits in a loyalty program, hotel stay transactions, and data related to customer stays. The program interacts with SQL databases to retrieve and insert data, and handles SQL errors through specific routines. It uses various data structures and variables to store and manipulate data related to customer promotions, bonus codes, credit card information, date conversions, and more. The program also includes procedures for calculating base points, checking eligibility for arrival bonuses, creating bonus stays, and processing and calculating elite nights for a hotel's reward program. The code also includes a series of SQL INCLUDE statements, which are used to include external SQL files into the program. These files likely contain SQL queries or other database-related code. The program also defines data structures for writing to different data streams, each with its own set of fields. The program also includes a detailed maintenance history, documenting changes and updates made to the program over time. The program also includes a warning about a necessary modification to the definition of FOLIOSTAY_ID after the code is generated and transferred to a dataset. This modification is necessary due to limitations in handling the COBOL conversion of decimal fields within Action Macros.\n",

      "1. Use Case: Online Maintenance and Batch Processing\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL program RWDUSTY2 facilitates online maintenance and batch processing of stays for a hotel rewards system. It allows the application to add stays in real time instead of writing to transaction tables for later batch processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use Case: Data Structure Definition\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code defines a series of data structures and variables that are used for storing and manipulating data related to customer promotions, bonus codes, credit card information, date conversions, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use Case: Database Management\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code defines a series of data structures and SQL queries for a database management system. It includes SQL INCLUDE statements to include external SQL files into the program and declares SQL cursors to retrieve specific sets of data from the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use Case: Data Record Definition\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code defines data structures for different types of data records related to a hotel stay, such as the date of stay, payment type, total revenue, number of paid nights, airline partner ID, car partner ID, bonus codes, frequent flyer ID, run date and time, operator ID, confirmation number, folio name and number, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Use Case: Message and Data Stream Handling\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code defines several data structures for different types of messages and data streams. These data structures are used to store and manipulate data related to various operations in a system.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Use Case: Hotel Stay and Frequent Flyer Program Processing\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code defines data structures for various types of records related to a hotel stay and frequent flyer program. It also defines data structures for writing to data streams, with specific references to different types of messages such as ISSUE-STAYBEN, PROM-INFO2, MILES-PROM-HDLR-INFO, MSBENVAL-PARMS, MSBENVAL-REPLY, and PROMHDLR-INFO.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Use Case: Data Manipulation and SQL Query Execution\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code defines a data structure, performs SQL queries to fetch data from databases, and manipulates data based on certain conditions. It also includes several conditional checks and operations based on these checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Use Case: Hotel Stay Operations\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code performs various operations related to a customer's stay at a hotel. It moves various values into different fields, calls functions using buffers, checks conditions and performs operations based on these checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Use Case: Hotel Stay System Operations\n",
      "   Example: The COBOL code performs several operations related to a hotel stay system. It inserts data into a table, retrieves account status information, sets up a checkout action, checks if the old stay was a redemption stay, adjusts the number of nights, retrieves the current MRSTAY info, reinitializes certificate numbers, sets up data for a redemption stay, and checks the certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Use Case: Hotel Stay Transaction Processing\n",
      "    Example: The COBOL code performs several operations including initialization of variables, error handling, certificate processing, index increment, unused certificate flag setting, airline information update, stay benefit processing, and property-based point calculation.\n"
