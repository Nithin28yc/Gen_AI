      "\n",
      "| Improvements | Files | Additional Notes |\n",
      "|--------------|-------|------------------|\n",
      "| Use of PrintWriter instead of JSP for generating HTML | ViewBookServlet.java | Using JSP for generating HTML would have been a better approach as it separates the presentation logic from the business logic |\n",
      "| Lack of error handling | ViewBookServlet.java | The code does not handle any exceptions that may occur during database operations or other processes |\n",
      "| Inefficient use of HttpSession | ViewBookServlet.java | The code uses HttpSession to store the quantity of each book in the cart, which can lead to performance issues if the number of items in the cart is large |\n",
      "| Lack of validation | ViewBookServlet.java | The code does not validate user input, which can lead to security vulnerabilities |\n",
      "| Lack of modularity | ViewBookServlet.java | The code is not modular and does not follow the principles of object-oriented programming, making it difficult to maintain and extend |\n"
